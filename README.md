# AquaSense AI 🌱💧

AI-powered detection of irrigation issues using simple images or video — no sensors required.

AquaSense AI helps farmers quickly identify clogged drip lines, leaks, and irrigation failures using computer vision, saving water, time, and crops.

## 🚜 The Problem

In drip irrigation systems:
- Clogged or broken drippers often go unnoticed
- Issues are discovered too late, after crop damage
- Existing solutions rely on expensive sensors or manual inspection

This leads to:
- Water waste
- Yield loss
- Increased labor costs

---

## 💡 The Solution

AquaSense AI provides a simple workflow:

1. Capture an image or short video of the irrigation line
2. Upload it via a web interface
3. Receive an AI-based analysis highlighting potential issues

No hardware.  
No installation.  
Just a phone and the field.

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)

- Computer vision analyzes water flow patterns and soil moisture indicators
- The system compares visual anomalies against learned patterns
- Results are returned as a simple, actionable response

This repository currently contains an MVP scaffold and placeholder logic to validate the system architecture.
